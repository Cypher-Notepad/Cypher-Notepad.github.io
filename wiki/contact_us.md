<p>Hi, I'm Dong-Geon Lee, a 24-year-old Korean developer. I have been developing software since 2015, starting my Uni life in Kwangwoon University in S.Korea. I keep learning to be a skilled server developer, but also am willing to develop anything practical that can give people a convenience. It's just my pleasure for people to use my program.

?> **Personal Motivation**
<br>The Cypher Notepad was just my Uni assignment when I was third year student in 2018. Even it didn't have its name as it does now. It was nothing more than crypto-functioning text-box. I don't know why, suddenly, I just wanted to make it better and now that useless thing became what it is currently. When I decided to develop this, I had confidence in Java programming and wanted to apply design patterns I learned from Uni on it. While I was developing it, there was some suffering but finally I myself can estimate it has reached satisfying level.
<br>&nbsp;There were many people who have interests on my project, Cypher Notepad, than I expected. I really appreciate them being interested and giving some advices. Especially, I would like to give SPECIAL THANKS to **Mason Blanford** who supports my poor English while creating this documentation.
